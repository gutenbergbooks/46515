<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The purpose of this Collection is to put before children, and
young people, poems which are good in themselves, and especially
fitted to live, as Theocritus says, &#8216;on the lips of the
young.&#8217; The Editor has been guided to a great extent, in
making his choice, by recollections of what particularly
pleased himself in youth. As a rule, the beginner in poetry
likes what is called &#8216;objective&#8217; art&mdash;verse with a story in it,
the more vigorous the story the better. The old ballads
satisfy this taste, and the Editor would gladly have added more
of them, but for two reasons. First, there are parents who
would see harm, where children see none, in &#8216;Tamlane&#8217; and
&#8216;Clerk Saunders.&#8217; Next, there was reason to dread that the
volume might become entirely too Scottish. It is certainly a
curious thing that, in Mr. Palgrave&#8217;s <cite>Golden Treasury</cite>, where
some seventy poets are represented, scarcely more than a tenth
of the number were born north of Tweed. In this book, however,
intended for lads and lassies, the poems by Campbell, by
Sir Walter Scott, by Burns, by the Scottish song-writers, and
the Scottish minstrels of the ballad, are in an unexpectedly
large proportion to the poems by English authors. The
Editor believes that this predominance of Northern verse is
not due to any exorbitant local patriotism of his own. The
singers of the North, for some reason or other, do excel in
poems of action and of adventure, or to him they seem to excel.
He is acquainted with no modern ballad by a Southern Englishman,
setting aside &#8216;<a href="#CHRISTABEL">Christabel</a>&#8217;
and the &#8216;<a href="#THE_RIME_OF_THE_ANCIENT_MARINER">Ancient Mariner</a>&mdash;&#8217;
poems hardly to be called ballads&mdash;which equals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
 &#8216;<a href="#THE_EVE_OF_ST_JOHN">The Eve of St. John.</a>&#8217; For spirit-stirring
martial strains few Englishmen since Drayton have been rivals of Campbell, of Scott,
of Burns, of Hogg with his song of &#8216;Donald McDonald.&#8217; Two
names, indeed, might be mentioned here: the names of the
late Sir Francis Doyle and of Lord Tennyson. But the
scheme of this book excludes a choice from contemporary poets.
It is not necessary to dwell on the reasons for this decision.
But the Editor believes that some anthologist of the future will
find in the poetry of living English authors, or of English
authors recently dead, a very considerable garden of that kind
of verse which is good both for young and old. To think for
a moment of this abundance is to conceive more highly of
Victorian poetry. There must still, after all, be youth and
mettle in the nation which could produce &#8216;The Ballad of the
Revenge,&#8217; &#8216;Lucknow,&#8217; &#8216;The Red Thread of Honour,&#8217; &#8216;The
Loss of the Birkenhead,&#8217; &#8216;The Forsaken Merman,&#8217; &#8216;How
they brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,&#8217; &#8216;The Pied
Piper of Hamelin,&#8217; and many a song of Charles Kingley&#8217;s,
not to mention here the work of still later authors. But we
only glean the fields of men long dead.</p>

<p>For this reason, then&mdash;namely, because certain admirable
contemporary poems, like &#8216;Lucknow&#8217; and &#8216;The Red Thread
of Honour,&#8217; are unavoidably excluded&mdash;the poems of action,
of war, of adventure, chance to be mainly from Scottish
hands. Thus Campbell and Scott may seem to hold a pre-eminence
which would not have been so marked had the
works of living poets, or of poets recently dead, been available.
Yet in any circumstances these authors must have occupied
a great deal of the field: Campbell for the vigour which the
unfriendly Leyden had to recognise; Scott for that Homeric
quality which, since Homer, no man has displayed in the
same degree. Extracts from his long poems do not come
within the scope of this selection. But, estimated even by his
lyrics, Scott seems, to the Editor, to justify his right, now
occasionally disdained, to rank among the great poets of his
country. He has music, speed, and gaiety, as in &#8216;<a href="#HUNTING_SONG">The Hunting
Song</a>&#8217; or in &#8216;<a href="#NORAS_VOW">Nora&#8217;s Vow:</a>&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For all the gold, for all the gear,</span>
<span class="i0">For all the lands both far and near</span>
<span class="i0">That ever valour lost or won,</span>
<span class="i0">I would not wed the Earlie&#8217;s son!</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Lines like these sing themselves naturally in a child&#8217;s memory,
while there is a woodland freshness and a daring note in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, Brignall banks are wild and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And Greta woods are green.</span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8216;<a href="#YOUNG_LOCHINVAR">Young Lochinvar</a>&#8217; goes &#8216;as dauntingly
as wantonly&#8217; to his bridal, as the heir of Macpherson&#8217;s Rant to his death,
in a wonderful swing and gallop of verse; while still, out of dim
years of childhood far away, one hears how all the bells are
ringing in Dunfermline town for the wedding of <a href="#ALICE_BRAND">Alice Brand</a>.
From childhood, too, one remembers the quietism of Lucy
Ashton&#8217;s song, and the monotone of the measure&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vacant heart and hand and eye,</span>
<span class="i0">Easy live and quiet die.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The wisdom of it is as perceptible to a child as that other
lesson of Scott&#8217;s, which rings like a clarion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To all the sensual world proclaim</span>
<span class="i0">One glorious hour of crowded life</span>
<span class="i2">Is worth an age without a name.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there are his martial pieces, as the &#8216;<a href="#GATHERING_SONG_OF_DONALD_DHU">Gathering Song
of Donald Dhu</a>&#8217; and &#8216;<a href="#THE_CAVALIER">The Cavalier</a>,&#8217; and there is the inimitable
simplicity and sadness of &#8216;<a href="#PROUD_MAISIE">Proud Maisie</a>,&#8217; like the dirge
for Clearista by Meleager, but with a deeper tone, a stronger
magic; and there is the song, which the Fates might sing in
a Greek chorus, the song which Meg Merrilies sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Twist ye, twine ye, even so!</span>
</div></div>

<p>These are but a few examples of Scott&#8217;s variety, his
spontaneity, his hardly conscious mastery of his art. Like
Phemius of Ithaca, he might say &#8216;none has taught me but
myself, and the God has put into my heart all manner of
lays&#8217;&mdash;all but the conscious and elaborate &#8216;manner of lays,&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
which has now such power over some young critics that they
talk of Scott&#8217;s redeeming his bad verse by his good novels.
The taste of childhood and of maturity is simpler and more pure.</p>

<p>In the development of a love of poetry it is probable that
simple, natural, and adventurous poetry like Scott&#8217;s comes
first, and that it is followed later&mdash;followed but not superseded&mdash;by
admiration of such reflective poetry as is plain and even
obvious, like that of Longfellow, from whom a number of
examples are given. But, to the Editor at least, it seems that
a child who cares for poetry is hardly ever too young to delight
in mere beauty of words, in the music of metre and rhyme,
even when the meaning is perhaps still obscure and little
considered. A child, one is convinced, would take great
pleasure in Mr. Swinburne&#8217;s choruses in &#8216;Atalanta,&#8217; such as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before the beginning of years,</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and in Shelley&#8217;s &#8216;Cloud&#8217; and his
<a href="#ARETHUSA">&#8216;Arethusa</a>.&#8217;
For this reason a number of pieces of Edgar Poe&#8217;s are given, and
we have not shrunk even from including the faulty &#8216;<a href="#ULALUME">Ulalume</a>,&#8217;
because of the mere sound of it, apart from the sense. The
three most famous poems of Coleridge may be above a child&#8217;s
full comprehension, but they lead him into a world not
realised, &#8216;an unsubstantial fairy place,&#8217; bright in a
morning mist, like our memories of childhood.</p>

<p>It is probably later, in most lives, that the mind wakens to
delight in the less obvious magic of style, and the less ringing,
the more intimate melody of poets like Keats and Lord
Tennyson. The songs of Shakespeare, of course, are for all
ages, and the needs of youth comparatively mature are met
in Dryden&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="#ALEXANDERS_FEAST">Ode on Alexander&#8217;s Feast</a>,&#8217;
and in &#8216;<a href="#LYCIDAS">Lycidas</a>&#8217; and the &#8216;Hymn for the Nativity.&#8217;</p>

<p>It does not appear to the Editor that poems about children,
or especially intended for children, are those which a child
likes best. A child&#8217;s imaginative life is much spent in the
unknown future, and in the romantic past. He is the contemporary
of Leonidas, of <a href="#BALLAD_OF_AGINCOURT">Agincourt</a>,
of <a href="#BANNOCKBURN">Bannockburn</a>, of the &#8216;45;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
he is living in an heroic age of his own, in a
Phæacia where the Gods walk visibly. The poems written
for and about children, like Blake&#8217;s and some of Wordsworth&#8217;s,
rather appeal to the old, whose own childhood is now to them
a distant fairy world, as the man&#8217;s life is to the child. The
Editor can remember having been more mystified and puzzled by
&#8216;<a href="#LUCY_GRAY_OR_SOLITUDE">Lucy Gray</a>&#8217;
than by the &#8216;<a href="#THE_EVE_OF_ST_JOHN">Eve of St. John</a>,&#8217; at a very early age.
He is convinced that Blake&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="#NURSES_SONG">Nurse&#8217;s Song</a>,&#8217; for example, which
brings back to him the long, the endless evenings of the Northern
summer, when one had to go to bed while the hills beyond
Ettrick were still clear in the silver light, speaks more intimately
to the grown man than to the little boy or girl. Hood&#8217;s
&#8216;<a href="#I_REMEMBER_I_REMEMBER">I remember, I remember</a>,&#8217;
in the same way, brings in the burden of reflection on that which the child cannot possibly
reflect upon&mdash;namely, a childhood which is past. There is the
same tone in Mr. Stevenson&#8217;s &#8216;Child&#8217;s Garden of Verse,&#8217; which
can hardly be read without tears&mdash;tears that do not come and
should not come to the eyes of childhood. For, beyond the
child and his actual experience of the world as the ballads and
poems of battle are, he can forecast the years, and anticipate
the passions. What he cannot anticipate is his own age,
himself, his pleasures and griefs, as the grown man sees them
in memory, and with a sympathy for the thing that he has
been, and can never be again. It is his excursions into the
untravelled world which the child enjoys, and this is what
makes Shakespeare so dear to him&mdash;Shakespeare who has
written so little on childhood. In <cite>The Midsummer Night&#8217;s
Dream</cite> the child can lose himself in a world familiar to him,
in the fairy age, and can derive such pleasure from Puck, or
from Ariel, as his later taste can scarce recover in the same
measure. Falstaff is his playfellow, &#8216;a child&#8217;s Falstaff, an innocent
creature,&#8217; as Dickens says of Tom Jones in <cite>David Copperfield</cite>.</p>

<p>A boy prefers the wild Prince and Poins to Barbara
Lewthwaite, the little girl who moralised to the lamb. We
make a mistake when we &#8216;write down&#8217; to children; still more
do we err when we tell a child not to read this or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
because he cannot understand it. He understands far more
than we give him credit for, but nothing that can harm him.
The half-understanding of it, too, the sense of a margin beyond,
as in a wood full of unknown glades, and birds, and
flowers unfamiliar, is great part of a child&#8217;s pleasure in
reading. For this reason many poems are included here in
which the Editor does not suppose that the readers will be
able to pass an examination. For another reason a few pieces
of no great excellence as poetry are included. Though they
may appear full of obviousness to us, there is an age of dawning
reflection to which they are not obvious. Longfellow, especially,
seems to the Editor to be a kind of teacher to bring
readers to the more reflective poetry of Wordsworth, while he
has a sort of simple charm in which there is a foretaste of
the charm of Tennyson and Keats. But everyone who attempts
to make such a collection must inevitably be guided by his
own recollections of childhood, of his childish likings, and
the development of the love of poetry in himself. We have
really no other criterion, for children are such kind and
good-natured critics that they will take pleasure in whatever is
given or read to them, and it is hard for us to discern where
the pleasure is keenest and most natural.</p>

<p>The Editor trusts that this book may be a guide into
romance and fairyland to many children. Of a child&#8217;s enthusiasm
for poetry, and the life which he leads by himself in
poetry, it is very difficult to speak. Words cannot easily bring
back the pleasure of it, now discerned in the far past like a
dream, full of witchery, and music, and adventure. Some
children, perhaps the majority, are of such a nature that they
weave this dream for themselves, out of their own imaginings,
with no aid or with little aid from the poets. Others, possibly
less imaginative, if more bookish, gladly accept the poet&#8217;s help,
and are his most flattering readers. There are moments in
that remote life which remain always vividly present to
memory, as when first we followed the chase with Fitz-James, or first
learned how &#8216;The Baron of Smaylho&#8217;me rose with day,&#8217; or first heard how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All day long the noise of battle roll&#8217;d</span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains by the winter sea.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Almost the happiest of such moments were those lulled
by the sleepy music of &#8216;The Castle of Indolence,&#8217; a poem now
perhaps seldom read, at least by the young. Yet they may
do worse than visit the drowsy castle of him who wrote</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when a shepherd of the Hebrid isles</span>
<span class="i0">Placed far amid the melancholy main.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Childhood is the age when a love of poetry may be born
and strengthened&mdash;a taste which grows rarer and more rare
in our age, when examinations spring up and choke the good
seed. By way of lending no aid to what is called Education,
very few notes have been added. The child does not want
everything to be explained; in the unexplained is great
pleasure. Nothing, perhaps, crushes the love of poetry more
surely and swiftly than the use of poems as school-books.
They are at once associated in the mind with lessons, with
long, with endless hours in school, with puzzling questions
and the agony of an imperfect memory, with grammar
and etymology, and everything that is the enemy of joy. We
may cause children to hate Shakespeare or Spenser as Byron
hated Horace, by inflicting poets on them, not for their
poetry, but for the valuable information in the notes. This
danger, at least, it is not difficult to avoid in
the <cite>Blue Poetry Book</cite>.

<span class="i0">Through caverns measureless to man</span>
<span class="i4">Down to a sunless sea.</span>
<span class="i0">So twice five miles of fertile ground</span>
<span class="i0">With walls and towers were girdled round:</span>

<span class="i0">Where blossom&#8217;d many an incense-bearing tree;</span>
<span class="i0">And here were forests ancient as the hills,</span>

<span class="i0">As e&#8217;er beneath a waning moon was haunted</span>
<span class="i0">By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</span>
<span class="i0">And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething</span>
<span class="i0">As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</span>
<span class="i0">A mighty fountain momently was forced:</span>

<span class="i0">Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</span>
<span class="i0">Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</span>

<span class="i0">The shadow of the dome of pleasure</span>
<span class="i0">Floated midway on the waves;</span>
<span class="i0">Where was heard the mingled measure</span>

<span class="i0">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile.</span>
<span class="i0">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God&#8217;s especial grace;</span>
<span class="i0">And the tall &#8216;Pinta,&#8217; till the noon, had held her close in chase.</span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;</span>
<span class="i0">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe&#8217;s lofty hall;</span>
<span class="i0">Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast,</span>
<span class="i0">And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.</span>
<span class="i0">With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;</span>
<span class="i0">Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;</span>
<span class="i0">His yeomen round the market cross make clear an ample space;</span>
<span class="i0">For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.</span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells</span>
<span class="i0">As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.</span>
<span class="i0">Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,</span>
<span class="i0">And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down.</span>
<span class="i0">So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,</span>
<span class="i0">Bohemia&#8217;s plume, and Genoa&#8217;s bow, and Cæsar&#8217;s eagle shield.</span>
<span class="i0">So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,</span>

<span class="i0">One day the boy his breakfast took,</span>
<span class="i0">And ate it by a purling brook.</span>
<span class="i0">Which through his mother&#8217;s orchard ran.</span>
<span class="i0">From that time ever when he can</span>
<span class="i0">Escape his mother&#8217;s eye, he there</span>

<span class="i0">With free leave Henry every day</span>
<span class="i0">Thither repairs, until she heard</span>
<span class="i0">Him talking of a fine <em>grey bird</em>.</span>
<span class="i0">This pretty bird, he said, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Came every day with him to feed,</span>
<span class="i0">And it loved him and loved his milk,</span>
<span class="i0">And it was smooth and soft like silk.</span>
<span class="i0">His mother thought she&#8217;d go and see</span>
<span class="i0">What sort of bird this same might be.</span>
<span class="i0">So the next morn she follows Harry,</span>
<span class="i0">And carefully she sees him carry</span>
<span class="i0">Through the long grass his heap&#8217;d-up mess.</span>
<span class="i0">What was her terror and distress,</span>
<span class="i0">When she saw the infant take</span>
<span class="i0">His bread and milk close to a snake!</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the grass he spreads his feast,</span>
<span class="i0">And sits down by his frightful guest,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had waited for the treat;</span>
<span class="i0">And now they both began to eat.</span>
<span class="i0">Fond mother! shriek not, O beware</span>
<span class="i0">The least small noise, O have a care&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The least small noise that may be made,</span>
<span class="i0">The wily snake will be afraid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If he hear the lightest sound,</span>
